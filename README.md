# C.O.R.E. — Crisis Operations & Response Ecosystem

> A real-time emergency incident management platform for hospitals and hotels.  
> Staff manage incidents on a live dashboard. Patients/guests report emergencies via a QR code portal — no app required.

## 🏆 Why C.O.R.E. Wins (The "WOW" Factors)

Judges naturally ask: *"Is this just another CRUD app?"*  
**No. C.O.R.E. is incredibly smart and built for the real world.**

- ⚡ **QR + Instant Onboarding:** Scan to report instantly. No app installation, no login required for guests/patients.
- 🧠 **Smart Assignment Engine:** The system automatically routes incidents to the available staff member nearest to the crisis (e.g. same floor) while load balancing active incidents.
- 🗺️ **Dynamic Location Handling:** Not just a fixed "Floor" dropdown. Our portal handles exact rooms, corridors, lobby areas, and manual location entries.
- 📱 **Guest Live Feedback Loop:** The moment a staff member claims an incident, the patient's portal instantly displays *"Help is on the way. Assigned to: [Staff Name]"*. This provides absolute human-centric reassurance.
- 📷 **AI Camera Detection Mockup:** Simulates real-time hardware integration where CCTV cameras identify threats (e.g., Fire, Security Breaches) and auto-create incident reports with confidence ratings.
- 📊 **Real-time Analytics Dashboard:** Aggregates average response time, common issues, and active staff loads directly onto the admin dashboard for immediate insights.

## 🚨 The Core Problem

## ✨ Features

### 🏥 Multi-Domain Support
- Runs in **Hospital mode** (Patients, Doctors, Nurses, Receptionists, Administrators) and **Hotel mode** (Guests, Security, Maintenance, Front Desk, Hotel Managers) from a single codebase
- Domain-isolated data — hospital staff never see hotel incidents and vice versa

### 📱 QR Code Patient/Guest Portal
- Reception generates a unique QR code on check-in
- Patient/guest scans it on their phone → opens a mobile-optimised portal (no login, no app)
- **Geofence enforcement** — incident reports are only accepted within a configurable radius of the property
- Incident types: Medical Emergency, Fire/Smoke, Security Breach, Maintenance Issue, Other
- Optional photo/video evidence attachment

### ⚡ Real-Time Incident Feed (Socket.io)
- Incidents appear on staff dashboards **instantly** via WebSocket — no polling
- Status updates (`Pending → In Progress → Resolved`) broadcast to all connected staff in real time
- **Auto-escalation**: if any incident remains `Pending` for 2 minutes, a system-wide emergency buzz fires automatically

### 🚨 Emergency Broadcast Buzz
- Administrators can send a system-wide emergency alert to **all** staff and patient portals simultaneously (one click)
- Fire incidents trigger an automatic buzz to all connected users
- Plays a loud klaxon alarm on all devices

### 🔐 Role-Based Access Control
| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| Administrator / Hotel Manager | Full access: staff management, audit logs, system config, all incidents |
| Doctor / Nurse / Security | Assigned-floor incident feed |
| Receptionist / Front Desk | Patient/guest check-in, QR generation, discharge |
| Patient / Guest | QR portal only (no login required) |

### 📋 Audit Trail
- Every staff action (login, check-in, discharge, config change) is logged with timestamp and user
- Admin-only audit log view

### 🗺️ Geofence Configuration
- Administrators set GPS coordinates and radius (metres) for their property
- Portal blocks submissions from users outside the perimeter

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A [Neon](https://neon.tech) project (free tier works)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/c.o.r.e.git
cd "Solution challenge"

# Install server dependencies
cd server && npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client && npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

**`server/.env`**
```env
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@ep-xxx-yyy.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://user:password@ep-xxx-yyy.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
JWT_SECRET="your-strong-secret-here"
CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:5173"
```

> Get your Neon connection string from:  
> **Neon Dashboard → Project → Connection Details**  
> (Use the same connection string for both `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL`)

**`client/.env`**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 3. Push Database Schema

```bash
cd server
npx prisma db push
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash

## 🗃️ Database Schema

```
User          — Staff accounts with role and domain
Session       — Patient/guest QR sessions
Incident      — Emergency reports linked to sessions
SystemConfig  — Geofence settings per domain
AuditLog      — Staff action history
```

---

## 🔒 Security Notes
